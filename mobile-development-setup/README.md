# 📱 Mobile Development Environment Setup  

## 0. Setting Up and Testing Your Mobile Development Environment  

### 🎯 Objective  
Mobile development requires more computational resources compared to web development. To simplify the setup, we are using the **Expo Framework for React Native**, which makes building and testing mobile apps faster and easier.  

This step ensures you have all the required tools to begin development.  

---

## ✅ Requirements  
Before starting, make sure the following are installed on your system:  

- **Node.js LTS**  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**  
- **macOS, Linux, or Windows** operating system  
- **Expo Go** app on your physical device (Android or iOS)  

These tools are essential to run upcoming projects smoothly.

## 📌 Why Expo Go?  
Traditionally, mobile app development requires heavy emulators (Android Studio, Xcode). Running these often demands expensive hardware.  

**Expo Go** provides a lightweight and cost-effective solution:  
- Test your app directly on your **physical device**  
- Works on both **iOS and Android**  
- Always up-to-date with the latest React Native SDKs
