## About  
This repository provides a robust starting point for cross-platform mobile app development using modern technologies. It combines:  
- React Native for building mobile UIs  
- TypeScript for type-safe development  
- NativeWindCSS for utility-first styling in React Native  
- Expo for streamlined build, development and deployment experience

By using this setup youâ€™ll be able to start new mobile projects quickly and follow best practices out-of-the-box.

## Features  
- TypeScript configured and enforced for safer code  
- Utility-first styling via NativeWindCSS for faster UI development  
- Expo integration: hot-reloading, easy builds, and cross-platform support  
- Standardised folder structure and scaffolding for scalability  
- Clean, minimal starting point with no unnecessary dependencies  

## Tech Stack  
- **React Native** â€” for cross-platform mobile UI  
- **TypeScript** â€” to catch errors early and improve maintainability  
- **NativeWindCSS** â€” utility-first styling solution for React Native  
- **Expo** â€” simplifies development, builds and deployment  
- Additional tooling: ESLint, Prettier (you may add these as appropriate)  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
Make sure you have the following installed:  
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)  
- npm or yarn  
- Expo CLI globally (optional but recommended):  
  ```bash  
  npm install --global expo-cli  
    ```

* A mobile device (iOS/Android) or emulator/simulator

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SireTallest/prodev-mobile-setup.git  
   cd prodev-mobile-setup  
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install  
   # or  
   yarn install  
   ```
3. If using Expo, you may need to install the Expo Go app on your device, or run a simulator.

### Running the App

Once installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run start  
# or  
yarn start  
```

Then follow the instructions: scan the QR code with Expo Go, or open in emulator/simulator for iOS/Android.

## Project Structure

```
/prodev-mobile-setup  
â”œâ”€â”€ app/  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ â€¦        # your React Native screens & components  
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ â€¦        # images, fonts and static files  
â”œâ”€â”€ nativewind.config.ts  # styling config  
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration  
â”œâ”€â”€ app.json / expo.config.js  
â””â”€â”€ package.json  
```

> *Tip:* Maintain clear separation between UI components, business logic and styles to keep your app maintainable as it scales.

## Usage

* Add new screens under `app/screens/`.
* Use NativeWind classes for styles, e.g. `<View className="flex-1 bg-white p-4">`.
* Type definitions go under `app/types/`.
* You can eject from Expo later if you need custom native modules.
